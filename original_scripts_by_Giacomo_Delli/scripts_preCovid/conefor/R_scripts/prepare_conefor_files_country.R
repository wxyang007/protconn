## The following lines ("for" loop) will account and correct for the cases (ISO3 codes) that have nothing written in the distance file, which can be because of two reasons:
## 1) There is only one node (one PA) and hence do not have any distance calculated between any pair of PAs
## 2) There are several PAs but they are separated by a distance larger than the maximum dispersal distance considered (300 km) and hence there are no distance values in the distance file
## Both cases are solved in the same way: we add a "imaginary" or "fake" node in the node file, and we create a distance file with a distance that is almost infinite between this "imaginary" node and the first node that appears listed in the node file of the country
## This does not cause any change in the resultant connectivity values for the country, but allows to have the results of Conefor calculated systematically and in the same format and table for all countries (including the countries in this case that is here "corrected" or treated separately)
